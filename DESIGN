

ideas brainstorming

what we want to filter :
- 300 products
- only online
- at least one for every online category (assignments are in site-catalog file)
- intermediate goals: 
   

loops over sitecat file:
 - category definitions,  online-flag = true    required
 - category-assignment,   category / product-id   relationship  of a master. 
 -> make a list for these.  in a file or in mem. 
 
 
 
loops over the master catalog xml: 
1.  sax;
    -make a file that has every product obj storing: sku,starttaglocation/endtaglocation
    -make list of skus(master-only) and also use its variants in <variants> section. 
    
    that satisfy filters.
         filters:
            - must be online :       online-flag  true
            - must be categorized via the sitecatalog:    this master sku is found in the sitecat list.
            
            
2.  raw parse mastercat : 
    -get all variants of the found items from loop 1.
    
    
    



devsitecat.xml :  

    <category-assignment category-id="men-sale-shirts" product-id="159466">
        <primary-flag>true</primary-flag>
    </category-assignment>

it has categories that are online, or off. 

    <category category-id="trend-report-stripes-for-days">
        <display-name xml:lang="x-default">Stripes for Days</display-name>
        <online-flag>true</online-flag>
        
and       assignments: 
    <category-assignment category-id="Hawaii" product-id="410764"/>
